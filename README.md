# 🍲 What's for Dinner? The Smart Recipe Finder!

Ever stare into your fridge, full of ingredients but with no idea what to make? This tool is your new best friend! Just tell it what you have, and it'll intelligently search a massive online database to find the best possible recipes you can cook right now.

## ✨ How It Works: A Step-by-Step Journey

🍳 Smart Ingredient Search: Start with your star ingredient, and the app finds all possible recipes. Then, it cleverly filters that list using every other ingredient you have, giving you truly personalized results.

🥇 Top Matches First: No more guessing! Recipes are ranked and scored. You'll see perfect matches at the top, followed by those needing just one or two extra items.

📖 Quality Control: Say goodbye to confusing recipes! The app automatically filters out dishes with bad or incomplete instructions, showing you only clear, high-quality guides.

🎯 Precision Matching: The search is smart enough to know the difference between "ham" and "shame." It looks for whole words to prevent silly mistakes and give you hyper-accurate matches.

🧂 Pantry Staples Included: Don't worry about listing salt, pepper, or oil. The app knows you probably have these and won't penalize a recipe for including them.

💻 Simple Guided Process: A friendly command-line prompt walks you through each step, from entering ingredients to choosing your final recipe. It's easy and intuitive!
